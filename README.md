BWMirror API
=========

## Directory explanation

- bwapi-data/ : just some BWTA analyzed maps, so you can test the API in real game
- bwapi4-includes/ : the headers from BWAPI4, for now, just paste the headers here, the generators uses these to create the .java files and then the .cpp
- bwta2-c/ : the headers from BWTA2, same as above 
- c4/ : the final .cpp, generated by the project, kept in the repo just as a showcase
- lib/ : only jsoup to parse htmls with documentation
- manual-bwapi/ : .java files which are added to the API, used to inject custom code. Used for **BWAPI3**
- manual-bwapi4/ : .java files which are added to the API, used to inject custom code. Used for **BWAPI4**


- javadoc_script.bat : script to generate javadoc for API, currently uses absolute paths, should be refactored
- gmp, mpfr dlls : these are required for BWTA2, if anyone managed to get static versions of these let me know
